### ScriptSignal:Connect(func: function, connectImmediately: boolean?)
```lua
local Connection = ScriptSignal:Connect(function()

### ScriptSignal:Once(func: function)
```lua
local Connection = ScriptSignal:Once(function()
    ...
end)

Creates a new connected `ScriptConnection`. The ScriptConnection will clean and garbage collect itself when it is fired for the first time.
### ScriptSignal:DisconnectAll()
```lua
ScriptSignal:DisconnectAll()
```
Disconnect and garbage collect all of ScriptSignal's ScriptConnections.
### ScriptSignal:DisconnectOne(identifier: string)
```lua
ScriptSignal:DisconnectOne("GH4X-K93A-3914-FD3P-MN0O")
```
Disconnect any ScriptConnection connected to ScriptSignal with `identifier` as its identifier.
### ScriptSignal:Fire(...)
```lua
ScriptSignal:Fire(...)

### ScriptSignal:FireOne(identifier: string, args: {...})
```lua
ScriptSignal:FireOne("GH4X-K93A-3914-FD3P-MN0O", {...})
```
Fire any ScriptConnection connected to ScriptSignal with `identifier` as its identifier. Passes an unpacked version of `args` as arguments.
### ScriptSignal:GetState()

```
Get the current state of the ScriptSignal. **WARNING: Calling this method while the ScriptSignal is Dead will throw an error.**
